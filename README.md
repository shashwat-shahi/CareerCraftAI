# CareerCraft AI

## Concept

In today's rapidly changing job market, finding the right career path or the perfect candidate is more challenging than ever. With numerous industries undergoing digital transformation and the emergence of new job roles, individuals often find it difficult to navigate their career progression.

Similarly, recruiters face the daunting task of sifting through countless applications to find candidates who not only match the job description but also fit the company culture. This is where CareerCraft AI steps in - a sophisticated web application designed to streamline and personalize the career development and recruitment process.


Let us look at a small example of how a user could benefit from the proposed application.

Emily, a skilled graphic designer with five years of experience, begins her journey on our platform by registering and uploading her resume. Our AI system parses her resume, and she selects her career aspirations. In response, the AI generates tailored tutorial suggestions from Udemy based on her chosen career path. Emily completes the recommended courses, adds newly acquired skills to her profile, and receives job recommendations from LinkedIn in real time.

As she explores job postings, our AI system highlights keywords from the job descriptions and indicates the percentage match with her profile. This feature empowers Emily to make informed decisions, providing clarity and confidence as she progresses towards her next professional milestone in the competitive field of graphic design.
